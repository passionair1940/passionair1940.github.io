        <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="5"><b>His life: </b></font></p>
        <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Roger Jean ASTRUC was born on 
          Saturday, June 1st, 1918 to Corneilla-de-la-Rivière, Pyrénées-Orientales, 
          from Jean ASTRUC, 39, postman, mobilized, and of his wife Joséphine 
          Andreu, 29 years old, unemployed, born in Claira and residing in the 
          municipality. Roger is born in the house of his grandfather, Jean ASTRUC, 
          63 years old, farmer, name ASTRUC and ANDREU are typically Catalan: 
          ASTRUC means "born under a good star" or "Lucky" and ANDREU is André 
          in Catalan. While Roger has only 6 months, the family leaves the region 
          for Paris.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">He studied at the CONDORCET high 
          school in Paris where he obtained the Baccalauréat Sciences-Langues 
          and continues to draw. He is engaged as an industrial draftsman at the 
          Marcel BLOCH Aircraft, then in the Design Office of the aeronautical 
          manufacturer DEWOITINE in Courbevoie where he works from the end of 
          the 30s until the beginning of the war and during the occupation. His 
          fiancee, Aline ALARY is engaged in 1937 as secretary by Marcel BLOCH 
          (future Marcel DASSAULT) at the &quot;Rond-Point des Champs-Elysées&quot;.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">In early November 1938, he began 
          his military service in Chartres where he was assigned draftsman to 
          Commander Major. He then joined the EOR platoon (reserve Officer School) 
          on the Air base of Dugny (Seine). In April 1939, he entered the School 
          of improvement of Cazaux where he will be patented Sergeant Gunner on 
          July 13, 1939: Patent No. 2077 issued November 6, 1939.</font></b> 
        <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">. He briefly joined the base 
          of Dugny in August 1939 before being allocated to GB II / 34 - 4th Squadron 
          based in Poix (Somme). On Amiot 143, Roger will make within this Group, 
          diurnal and nocturnal bombardment missions from Dijon, Metz, among others, 
          before joining the Meknes Air Base in Morocco (BPH 404) during the fall 
          of Group. In August 1940, Roger Astruc joined GB I/31 2nd Squadron on 
          the Air Base of Istres. Finally, he is assigned to GR I / 14 (Air Reconnaissance 
          Group) based on the Air Base of Perpignan-Llabanère until his demobilization 
          in March 1941.</font></b> 
        <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow"> He is married May 17, 1941 at 
          the City hall of the 11th arrondissement of Paris with his fiancée Aline 
          Gabrielle Rose ALARY he will always call "Odette". He joined in 1943 
          the resistance network "Those of Liberation-Vengeance"; Arrested by 
          the Gestapo in 1944 in Paris for his name with Jewish consonance, he 
          was interned for 4 months in Fresnes prison where he was released, after 
          his wife's incessant steps, on the intervention of H. Carol, Director 
          of the factory of Boulogne of planes Marcel DASSAULT, and Jeff ROOS, 
          then President of INDAERO (then later Chairman of the Board of Air France), 
          narrowly escaping deportation. The trauma of war, which he evoked very 
          rarely and with great difficulty, will continue for the rest of his 
          life. He's quoted in the Order of the Air Force (War Cross with a palm). 
          After the war, he was very early part of the Amicale des Catalans de 
          Paris and participated in the magazine "Galeria" of a group of Spanish 
          Catalans refugees during the civil war. </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Roger will work after the war 
          until the retreat in the aeronautics by beginning with the S.N.C.A.S.O. 
          (National company of the Aircraft manufacturings of the Southwest) after 
          the Company is successively called the South-aviation, then S.N.I.A.S. 
          (National company of the Aircraft and spatial Industry) and finally 
          Aerospace industry (to be afterward transformed into Aérospatiale-Matra 
          and be altogether joined EADS which will become Group current Airbus). 
          Roger Astruc will always be very estimated for his user-friendliness 
          and recognized for his talent of advertising artist. His wife, as for 
          her, will make all her career in Planes Marcel Dassault and will retire 
          of Personal assistant of the factory Dassault of Boulogne-Billancourt.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">In 1953, the death of his father, 
          Jean, of whom he had painted the portrait repeatedly, affects him very 
          profoundly. </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">His only son Jean-Charles, is 
          born on July 14th, 1955 in Paris 8th district while he lives in 66 avenue 
          Secrétan Paris 19ème. He holds then a bookshop-stationery in Paris avenue 
          Secrétan. He becomes member of the freemasonry that he will frequent 
          of numerous years, and which will correspond well to the righteousness 
          and its intellectual rigor as well as to its character profoundly humanist, 
          but he will always remain dumb on this membership. </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">The death of his mother in 1968 
          to Claira is a new pain and the occasion of a quarrel with his only 
          older brother, who will be a few years later definitive </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">Roger participates proudly in 
          the adventure of the Concorde at the end of the 60s (shared with his 
          wife at Dassault who also participates in this construction). He is 
          responsible for a group in charge of the design and the realization 
          of the advertising in which, in spite of the partial abandonment of 
          the way which he wished to borrow originally, he was able to express 
          himself and find even the opportunity "to slide" Catalan themes in a 
          creation of another kind. </font></b></p>
        <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">He retires in 1978 then returns 
          with his wife " to the Country " to Espira-de-l'Agly, An almost permanent 
          state of depression eats away at him, in the grip of " morbid ideas 
          ". He cuts itself of most of his friends and the members of his family. 
          He gets on in the village with the Catalan poet Joan CAYROL with whom 
          he intended to begin again to draw to illustrate his poems, but the 
          latter died too early. Very attached " to the Country ", its native 
          Roussillon, where he had never stopped returning very regularly, Roger 
          dies on April 6th, 2000 to Espira-de-l'Agly where he is buried with 
          his wife who will support only not much time his disappearance (she 
          dies on March 27th, 2001). The family vault is a few meters away from 
          the grave of the Catalan poet Joan CAYROL. </font></b></p>

        <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">During his mobilization, he continues 
          to paint by occupying a large part of his time, between the missions, 
          with making numerous caricatures of his circle of acquaintances. After 
          the war, Roger sees frequently dedicatedly several Paris Academies where 
          he learns to draw and to paint.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">He thus decides after the war 
          to dedicate itself completely to the paint, but the very difficult economic 
          conditions and the food limitations of this period force him to continue 
          his work of draughtsman in parallel of his artistic creation. He envisages 
          in 1947 his departure for Brazil where he delivered some paintings for 
          exposures in September, 1946 in São-Paulo (" Dez Jovens Pintores Parisienses 
          " to the Galeria de Arte Ita) then in April, 1947 in Rio de Janeiro, 
          organized by one of his friends who, of over there, dissuades him from 
          trying the too much risked adventure; he will have besides then no piece 
          of news of these paintings.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Roger takes one sabbatical year 
          in 1946-1947 to return " in country" and dedicate itself completely 
          à his paint, then organizes " first Show Of Art Catalan* in Paris with 
          Catalans' association of Paris and his friend Roger</font></b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2"><b> 
          MONTANE</b></font><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2"> which has just 
          arrived in the capital to dedicate itself as him à the paint. This show 
          is organized in the gallery Lucien REYMAN, 64 kicks of Boétie Paris 
          8eme, and exposes more than 300 works (paints, watercolors, drawings, 
          engravings, sculptures, ceramic, cabinetmaking, illustration, binding, 
          literature, photography, music) of about 200 artists, among whom the 
          biggest Catalan artists and the artists sympathizers of the Catalan 
          culture: The retrospective works of Bausil, Delfau, Gonzales, Grey, 
          Maillol, Anglada, Manolo and Terrus, as well as the works of the contemporaries 
          Antagonizes, Brunette, Caseblanque, Cazals, Clav&eacute;, Creixams, 
          Delaris, Desnoyer, Dufy, Gili, Grau-Sala, Homs, Lafay, Marquet, Masson, 
          Short-sighted, Montan&eacute;, Mucha, Picasso, Pignon, Waroquier....<br>
          He exposes it a very noticed painting, the &quot; Catalan in the Rosary 
          &quot;, who will be acquired by the State in March, 1948 (by the Direction 
          of the Arts and Letters, the Ministry of Culture of period).<br>
          Till the end of the 40s, he makes extended stays " in the Country " 
          to Claira where live his parents, and painted in his native Roussillon 
          equipped with its colors, pallet and portable easel.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">He participates intensely in 
          numerous exhibitions during all these years: Winter Show, Show of the 
          French School, Show of the Real Independents, Show of people under thirty, 
          Art and the Resistance, Price of the Young Paint, Price of the Vikings, 
          Show of the New Realities, National Price, Price of the Villa of Este, 
          Critics' Prize, Show of May, when his paintings, very noticed because 
          early for the time, concern themes directly bound to the Catalan life 
          which he carries in him and proudly shares (old Catalans, interiors, 
          Catalan markets, ravaudeuses, Catalan villages, ...)</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">He meets Salvador DALI in August, 1957 at his home to Port-Lligat for a study of logarithmic spiral aimed at one of his paintings; on this occasion, he makes of his Catalan fellow countryman a portrait of which he will remain very proud.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Roger retires finally in 1978 then returns with his wife " to the Country " to Espira-de-l'Agly, where he will not make more than some very rare watercolors or gouaches to offer them. </font></b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2"></font></p>
