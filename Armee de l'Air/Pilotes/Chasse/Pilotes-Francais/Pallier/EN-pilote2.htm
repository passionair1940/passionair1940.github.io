  <p><font color="#660000"><b><i><font face="Arial Narrow" size="6">Biography</font></i></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2"><b>Gabriel Pallier was born October 10, 
    1896 in Quang-Yen (Tonkin).</b></font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Gabriel PALLIER committed to Limoges 
    on February 8, 1915 and took part in the 1st World War in the 21st regiment 
    of chasseurs. Marshal of Logis at SPA 15, he probably shot down two aircrafts.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">He then joined the Officers Schools 
    of Saumur then Saint-Maixent from 1921 to 1922 before joining the 35th Aviation 
    Regiment in October 1922 with the rank of sub lieutenant. On February 23, 
    1924, became a lieutenant, he was assigned to 8th Squadron of the Levant in 
    Damascus. He then joined the 3rd Aviation Regiment, 1st Rayack Squadron in 
    Syria, in June 1924. He left Syria on July 25, 1927.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Back in France, he was posted from 
    October 1928 to May 8, 1931 at the Avord Aviation School, then equipped with 
    Nieuport-Delage 29, and was promoted captain on March 25, 1930. From June 
    1931 to January 1934 he joined 4th Squadron Indochina in Tong, flying on Potez 
    TOE, unit in which he will carry out air raids.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">He returned to France and took command 
    of the 2nd Squadron of 1st Wing Light Aviation Defense at Dugny-Le Bourget 
    and Villacoublay from May 28, 1934 to October 28, 1936. On October 29, 1936, 
    he was appointed GC I/1 commander of the Etampes base, unit equipped with 
    Dewoitine D510. At the outbreak of hostilities, he joined his campaign airfield 
    at Chantilly-les-Aigles and put his group in order of battle. This one is 
    now equipped with Bloch MB152. Commander PALLIER left the group on April 10, 
    1940 to join the flying school of Saint-Cyr. Appreciated by all, he will be 
    greatly missed by the staff of his Group.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">In June 1940, he evacuated his school 
    to Toulouse-Francazal to try to reach North Africa, which he can finally achieve 
    due to lack of autonomy: the aircrafts are blocked on the home ground.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">The Commander Gabriel PALLIER is named 
    acting commander of the Toulouse-Francazal air park, but not wanting to collaborate 
    with the occupier, he prefers to ask for his dismissal of the aircrew and 
    is wiped out on March 15, 1941 of the cadres of the army air.<br>
    He joined the FFI in Paris in June 1943, and participated in the liberation 
    of the capital. He returned to the Air Force on February 10, 1947 and was 
    promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel on March 25, 1947. Placed on leave 
    of the aircrew, he will occupy administrative posts: commander of the 3rd 
    office of the 2nd aerial region in Paris, then commander of the air battalion 
    No. 01/104 Le Bourget-Dugny from February to October 1951 before being admitted 
    to retirement in 1951 and wiped out of the Air Force cadres on March 3 1958</font></b></p>
