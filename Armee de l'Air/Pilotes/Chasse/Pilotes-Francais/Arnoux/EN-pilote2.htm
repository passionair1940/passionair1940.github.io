  <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2"><b>Maurice ARNOUX was born on September 
    7, 1895 in Montrouge.</b></font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">At the declaration of the First World 
    War, he is 19 years old and commits himself. Maurice ARNOUX is assigned to 
    the 2nd aviation group in Bron, near Lyon. He will be in Serbia and will return 
    to Lyon in May 1916. He then passes his pilot's license, and after an internship 
    in Avord, he joins the front of Verdun as &quot;Infantry Pilot&quot;. He is 
    in charge of supporting the ground troops he must fly over at very low altitude.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">In April 1917 he was transferred to 
    the Fighter Squadron No. 49 and flew to Nieuport Monoplace. He will end the 
    war with a record of 5 wins.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">After the war, he became an industrialist 
    in Montrouge, but kept all his interest in aviation. He founded the Montrouge 
    Aeroclub, and participated in many competitions very popular in the interwar 
    period.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">He will become famous by winning the 
    cuts Deutsch de la Meurthe and Zenith. After having beaten numerous records 
    on FARMAN Aircraft, it is at the controls of the Caudron-Renault Rafale that 
    it will be definitively illustrated and will be recognized worldwide.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">In September 1939, then aged 44, he 
    asked to join a Fighting unit, refusing any other position less exposed. He 
    is assigned to GC III / 7 as Deputy Commander. His greatest fear was to be 
    transferred to some headquarters, and he refused a promotion to the rank of 
    Lieutenant-Colonel, for fear of not being able to fly ...</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Commander ARNOUX was shot and wounded 
    for the first time on May 10, 1940. He resumed the fight, and was twice called 
    to the command of the Army.<br>
    His ardor was in no way affected, he struck the enemy with terrible blows, 
    and had the honor of being twice summoned to the command of the army. His 
    last citation, the eleventh was awarded posthumously</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">On June 6, 1940, Commander ARNOUX attacks 
    a German fighter and the fight, observed from the ground by many witnesses, 
    is a fierce fight. Unfortunately, six more Messerschmitt BF109 mate in combat, 
    and the fight becomes uneven. The French fighter, particularly hit the empennage, 
    is distraught. Commander ARNOUX, undoubtedly seriously injured, attempts a 
    forced landing, with the train out. His Morane 406 will crush himself in a 
    field, and catch fire Maurice ARNOUX will receive his eleventh posthumous 
    citation ...</font></b></p>

      ARNOUX managed to join him and make two passes from behind. The German Bomber 
      tries to escape, and his rear gunner manages to hit the plane of the French 
      pilot. He abandons the fight, and is forced to land in Campaign, where his 
      Morane-Saulnier MS406 turns around. Commander ARNOUX will be slightly hurt.</b></font></p>

      mission of a Group of Breguet 693 and Leo 451, Commander ARNOUX is engaged 
      with a Messerschmitt BF109. The German pilot is rather skilled, and the 
      fight lasts for almost 10 minutes. On the ground, many spectators watch 
      the fight. After a candle, Commander ARNOUX seems to take over, when six 
      other German fighters intervene. The Morane-saulnier MS406, affected in 
      particular with the empennage, is distraught. Commander ARNOUX, outgoing 
      train, tries to land, but the plane is difficult to control and the pilot 
      seems injured. As he approaches the ground, the aircraft strikes a hill, 
      and despite attempts by the pilot to straighten, the plane flips and crashes 
      to the ground, where it catches fire instantly: Commander ARNOUX is killed 
      on the ground. stroke.</font></b></p>
